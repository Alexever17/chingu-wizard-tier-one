> Evaluate everyone''s current technical abilities.

> Pick something that is 25% outside of the team''s comfort zone / skillset.
> Any further and you will likely be overwhelmed.
> Any less and you are limiting your rate of learning.

> Database - consider the database type and ORM your team will use to interact with it

*Goal*: Decide on which workflow tools the team will use.

*Tips*:
> Don''t go overboard! Workflow tools are only useful when they are used. Keep it simple so that using the tools feels effortless rather than a chore.
> If you don''t already have a workflow or specific tools in mind consider the suggestions below.

*Suggested Workflow Tools*
>Besides the obvious Slack and Github the following are tools that work for many Chingu teams
> <https://www.waffle.io|Waffle> - Trello and Github had a baby that makes project management a breeze
> <https://www.discord.com|Discord> - "Always-on" communication tool. Leave it on mute while you work then unmute as needed to gain access to team mates for problem solving detours. Use it for clear audio while using Google Hangouts (don''t forget to mute the echo from Hangouts!)
> <https://hangouts.google.com|Google Hangouts> - A screensharing / pair-programming must (until VSC Live comes out!!)

*Suggested Use*:
> Hold a meeting on Discord and / or Hangouts to discuss the key steps required to complete the next sprint.
> Use Waffle to compartmentalize the steps of the sprints into grab-and-go tasks.
> Leave Discord on and unmute as needed to discuss and conquer roadblocks.
> Use Slack for short code snippets. Use Hangouts to screenshare for more complex debugging.

*A proper workflow and concise collection of workflow tools is what makes the difference between a team that makes it and one that doesn''t.*

> Ask for help from the community with setting up tools if you get stuck.
> Don''t get turned off because the setup seems daunting. It''s a one time process - take the time to do it right!

*Required*:
> Make sure everyone uses the tools.
> Walk through an example usage of each tool and how they all come together.
> Work out any kinks in people''s microphones, internet connections, permissions etc.

> Defining the MVP is committing to the bare minimum you and the team will accomplish before the cohort deadline.

> Front End - consider the views and their associated functionality
> Back End - consider the endpoints, routes and associated logic
> Database - consider the complexity of the database and associated models
> Deployment - consider how / where you will host the project

*Schedule a Meeting*
> Schedule your next meeting to plan your first sprint!

*Don't throw away those features and moonshot ideas that fall outside of the scope of the MVP!*
*Shoot for finishing the MVP ahead of schedule so the extra time can be used to implement those additional features and polish*

> In this act you will build the the html and css part of the landing page. You shouldn't concern yourself with javascript at this point.
> Splitting up the workload in a landing page can be difficult, but every web page can be divided into sections
> Here you can see a simple example: https://i.imgur.com/q0Z2SnH.png
> Your goal for the first sprint should be to complete at least one of your assigned areas.
> The tasks for each sprint *should require 9 days or less to complete*.
> Do your best but don't worry if you underestimate the required time - you can reflect and adjust in the next sprint.
> For Sprint I about the half of the page should be assigned

*Tips*:
> Devide and Conqour: Breaking a big task into small chuncks will help you focus and will give you a sense of accomplishement after compliting a section
> Better time-management: The smaller the task, the better it will fit into your section.
> Especially new developers don't have the habit or the time to code daily, be patient with your collegues if the take a while longer.
> Even though you may end up writting the same rules more then one time, a chingu project is about learning, not about shipping the best product
> Of course you will clean everything up in the end

*Workflow*:
> Now is the time to create cards for each of the tasks.
> Write the cards by adding descriptive titles and core details of the task as bullet points.
> The cards should serve as guidelines to each task with links to key references or specific notes that may be forgotten.
> Finish by reviewing and assigning the cards together as a team so that everyone is on the same page and knows what they are responsible for.

*What is this magic*:
> Sass makes CSS fun again. Sass is an extension of CSS, adding nested rules, variables, mixins, selector inheritance, and more.
> It's translated to well-formatted, standard CSS using the command line tool or a web-framework plugin.

*Where to learn*:
> http://www.sassshop.com/#/

*But why?*:
> "Oh almighty Wizard, why should I use this Sassy addition?"
> Thats easy: Avoid repetition for colors, borders and everything else. Easy nesting, no more .parent .nav ul li a:hover {}. Reduce complexity.

*Where to get*:
> http://sass-lang.com/

*Tips*:
> This is optional, you don't need to do it, but its recomended.

*Goal*: Adding descriptions to javascript functions, making sure everything is optimal and without magic numbers

*Term*:
> Magic numbersâ€™ are numbers that occur multiple time in code without an explicit meaning. They should preferably be replaced by named constants.
> finalPrice = dutyFreePrice + (dutyFreePrice * 0.25); BAD
> var TAX = 0.25; finalPrice = dutyFreePrice + (dutyFreePrice * TAX); GOOD
> The no-magic-numbers rule aims to make code more readable and refactoring easier by ensuring that special numbers are declared as constants to make their meaning explicit.

*Task*:
> Optimize your code as good as possible and avoid repetition
> Someday you might thank yourself for deleting all those nasty magic numbers
> Every function needs a description, thank yourself later

*Tips*:
> As a general rule, functions should be about 18 lines long, if there are longer you can probably make an additional function somewhere to ensure readablity of your code.
> Maybe you cant imagine it now, but in just about 6 month you will surely have written so many lines of code and finished so many projects that you will forget everything in this project!
> This happens even to a grand Wizard like me! That is why it is important to write prezise and clear description for any function in your javascript Code
> This will ensure that even if you go back to it after a year, you will find everything you need fast

> Show it to everyone, not only out of a feel of accomplishement, but to also inspire new members and aspiring developers.
> It shows that with enough dedication and hard work you can accomplish everything and be the developer you want to be.

*Talk*:
> This is the best time to reflect and think about the experience you gained in the last weeks and all the new techniques and tricks you learned.
> This is best done by writting it down. While writting you focus more and tend to write more prezise and clear.
> So by writting everthing down, you will hopefully see a distilled clear image of what you have accomplished and can always go back and remember again
> Especially our mistake and shortcomings are the things we want to correct, and this will not only help yourself but others too.
> There is a reason people still write textbooks in 2018! Through text we can reach everyone who needs to be reached

> Don't be shy about asking, many people have a great passion for coding and love to teach and help others
> It also never a bad thing to review code from a different person, there is no such thing as "learned everything", even for senior developers
